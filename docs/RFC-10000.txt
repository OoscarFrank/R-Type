              R-Type game network communication protocol

R-Type is a game created in 1987. It is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up
game. The player controls a spaceship and must destroy enemies and
bosses to finish the level. The player can also collect power-ups to
upgrade his spaceship. We re-created this game in 2023 with the same
gameplay, but with better graphics and sound, and with new features
including a multiplayer mode. This version of the game is a network
game. The player can play with other players on the same server.

1. Introduction

    This RFC defines the communication protocol between the server and
    the client for the network game "R-Type". The server is the host
    of the game, and the client is the player.

2. Motivation

    The protocol is designed to facilitate efficient and secure
    communication between the server and the client, necessary for the
    networking features of the game.

3. Requirements and Specifications

    This section details the requirements and specifications of the
    protocol.

    3.1. Data Format

        This protocol is designed to be used with the UDP protocol[1].
        The server and the client communicate with each other by
        sending and receiving datas. Datas are formatted using binary.
        Each data sent begins with one byte indicating the type of the
        data, followed by the data itself.

    3.2. Data Types

        Here is the list of the data types. The description of each
        data type is detailed in the next section. When a data type is
        sent by the server, it is prefixed by the letter "s". When a
        data type is sent by the client, it is prefixed by the
        letter "c".

        s-1 = screen progression
        c-2 = player asking to move
        s-3 = player position
        s-4 = missile position
        c-5 = player asking to shoot
        s-6 = player score
        s-7 = enemy position
        c-8 = player asking to create a room
        c-9 = player asking to join a room
        s-10 = room joined
        s-11 = time before the game starts
        c-12 = client ping
        s-13 = other player joined game
        s-14 = other player left game
        s-15 = missile destroyed

5. Communication Flow

    Each message is sent by the server to the client or by the client
    to the server. The server and the client can send and receive
    messages at any time. If the server does not receive a message
    from the client during 10 seconds, the client is considered
    disconnected.

6. Security and Error Handling

    If a command is not recognized by the server or the client, they
    won't do anything.
